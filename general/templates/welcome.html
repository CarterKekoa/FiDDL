    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>     Our project aims to make property access more convenient for both our consumer and those that they wish to let into their homes. 
        Losing/forgetting keys is an outdated hassle that affects over 20 million people a year in the US. Today your doorbell is not 
        just a doorbell, it can now record and display audio and video. Your keys must reach that same standard. Our product will not 
        only eliminate the need to remember one more thing every time you leave the house, but it would also save time and energy while 
        providing peace of mind with another level of home security. </p>  
    <p>     Our project involves an already created smart lock and video doorbell in addition to a web app to be developed by our team. We will 
        allow you (a homeowner) to access our app, create a profile, and upload pictures of yourself and dependents you wish to permit entry. 
        We will also provide users with the ability to add others from our database to their “Home” to allow them restricted access. These 
        photos will then be cross-checked against facial recognition data gathered from the video doorbell upon arrival. Any “permitted person” 
        will then be able to witness the door unlocking automatically in front of them. </p>
